        <h2>Personality Dive</h2>

        <p>Whenever I think of myself, three main traits come to mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expressive</li>
            <li>Resilient</li>
            <li>Disciplined</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These traits all make sense, considering my biggest hobby is working out and being consistent in the gym. As someone who has lost over 30lbs, I fully understand and live through resilience and discipline. I apply these traits in school, knowing that without hard work and self-discipline, I will fall behind and fail. Me being expressive is reflected through my passion to create different forms of work, whether videos, posters, writing pieces, anything that requires design and creative insight.</p>

        <img src="../Assets/Mulan.webp" alt="Mulan from Disney movie" class="mulan-img">

        <p>Currently, I wouldn't say I have a hero or anyone I look up to; however, the young woman I am today was shaped by my childhood hero, Fa Mulan. She is a Disney princess, the eldest daughter in her family who wants nothing more than to bring honour to her family's name, even if it means holding back who she really is on the inside. Being the eldest daughter myself, she resonated with me a lot. She was strong, resilient, and fierce. Though she had no fighting experience, she was willing to enlist in the army, at the risk of her own life, to save her father's life. My family means the world to me, so her actions were justifiable. Though she started at a disadvantage by being a woman, she worked twice as hard as all the other men enlisted in the camp to become the soldier who actually ended the war. Her being a woman and the one to end the war was also symbolic, as many men had fallen to the enemy, but she showed that not only brute strength is needed, but also intelligence and analytical skills. At the end of the story, she receives a sword engraved with four simple but powerful words: Loyal, Brave, True, and Devotion to Family. These are words I’ve held close to my heart and try to live by. She taught me that in a man's world, women have their place, and it does not have to be limited. We are just as strong, and our emotions are not weaknesses but motivations to keep pushing forward.</p>

        <h3>AI Businesses of 2025: Personalized Fitness and Nutrition Plans</h3>

        <p>For someone like me, who has over 3 years of experience in the gym, it's only natural that the personalized fitness and nutrition idea piqued my interest. Since I'm past the "newbie" phase, I know that some days I feel like a beast and others I'm just exhausted, so having an AI that actually "listens" to my body is a game-changer. It would be so useful because it can sync with my sleep and energy to swap a heavy leg day for a recovery session when I’m burnt out, or push me when I’m feeling my best. The main ethical concern is becoming too dependent on data and ignoring my own intuition, but my solution is to always prioritize how I feel physically and mentally over what the app suggests.</p>

        <p>
            A great example of this is 
            <a href="https://www.juggernautai.app/" target="_blank">JuggernautAI</a>, 
            which acts like a digital coach that adjusts workouts based on performance and recovery.
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Development</h3>

        <p>Reading these chapters from Twelve Pillars really shifted how I look at my life as a student. Chapter 4 made me realize that my goals are not just about getting a degree, but about the person I am becoming. I now understand the importance of choosing discipline over regret. In Chapter 5, I learned that being busy is not the same as being productive, and I am working on managing my time more effectively. Chapter 6 encouraged me to evaluate the people around me and surround myself with individuals who inspire growth. Finally, Chapter 7 reminded me that while formal education helps me make a living, self-education is what will truly shape my future.</p>
